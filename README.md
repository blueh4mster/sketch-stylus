## Introduction

This is a hand written and optimized machine learning library written in Rust using Arbitrum's Stylus [SDK](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-quickstart).

This library implements the following:

- K Nearest Neighbours
- Logistic Regression
- Digit Recognizer ML Model
- Machine Learning Math library

## Feautures

- For avoiding the loss of precision in weights and biases, scaling has been implemented.
- Minimal use of std library.
- The size of WASM contract and deployment gas for each is listed below.

### KNN

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

```javascript
interface IKNN {
   function trainPredict() external;

   function setK(uint256 val) external;

   function getK() external view returns (uint256);
}
```

### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didnâ€™t vote, based on a given data set of independent variables. This type of statistical model (also known as logit model) is often used for classification and predictive analytics.

```javascript
interface ILogReg {
    function train(int128[][] memory x_train, int128[][] memory y_train, uint128 iterations, int128 lr) external returns (bool);
}
```

### ML-math

This is a library for mathematical functions required within the different implementations of machine learning models. This includes various functions such as `sigmoid`, `sqrt`, `signum`, `softmax` and other matrix operations such as `matrix_mul`, `dot_product`, `matrix_sub`, `matrix_sum` etc.

   function scalarMul(int128[][] memory mat, int128 scalar) external pure returns (int128[][] memory);
}
```

### Digit Recognizer

Digit Recognition is a computer vision technique to predict the correct digits from pixel values of images. We have employed MNIST dataset for training.
